	Prof.Walsh helped me figure out with the practicality of doing the Karaoke idea as well as gave me more ideas on how I can add on to the karaoke aspect like using the led lights and the console for lyrics etc. As well as he explained the MIDI circuit and showed me how it works and how I can use it in MIPS.

	He helped me with figuring out easier way to find the MIDI notes and velocity and time stamps online. As well as he helped me attach the MIDI to the Southbridge to our current mips machine.

	I was having trouble with my chords since they were very jumbled and wasn't really sounding like Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. He helped me figure out the code to create a loop to wait till the chords have to play again. He also gave me more ideas on how to get the text, light and the sound to come out around the same time by using the same t variable in the beginning of the function.

	I was having trouble with my printLyrics function where only the Letter 'T' was printing thus, he helped me cut down unnecessary code and instead of counting the spaces in my lyrics, he told me to have a global variable that can store the pointer to my lyrics. Furthermore, he gave me an idea of using the first two unused bits as a form of instructions for either sound, lyrics to console or lights.

	My lyrics were being printed all at once and the chords were being sent to MIDI all at once as well, and prof.Walsh helped me figure out that due to the instruction bits in the beginning my srl for the time got messed up so I had to bitwise and to get the correct time. Also, he pointed out mistakes in my loops and helped me fix those as well.
